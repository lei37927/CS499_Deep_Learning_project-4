# CS499_Deep_Learning_Project-4

## Project Description
In this project our goal will be implementing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for a neural network with one hidden layer.

#### NNOneSplit function
See our implementation of NNetOneSplit function using R language [here](https://github.com/lei37927/CS499_Deep_Learning_project-3/blob/master/NNetOneSplit.R).

#### Gradient Descent Algorithm
You can also see our implementation of Gradient Descent Algorithm using R language [here](https://github.com/lei37927/CS499_Deep_Learning_Project-1/blob/master/GradientDescent.R).

#### Just in case
In case you cannot run the notebook, we have generated a web page version of the notebook with outputs.

See it [here](https://cefns.nau.edu/~zl248/cs499dl/project4) or source code [here](project4.html).

## How to run it
### 1 Environment Configuration
#### 1.1 Install Jupyter Notebook
Because the project is written in Python notebook, so it is necessary to have Jupyter on your machine.

You can install it [here](https://jupyter.org/install.html).

### 2 Having the project
#### 2.1 Download the project
You can use ```git clone``` to clone the project or just click the green button to download a ZIP file.

#### 2.2 Unzip the project
Use any tools you like to unzip the project into the folder you want.

### 3 Run the project
#### 3.1 Run Jupyter Notebook
***Remember to set default initialization path to the place where you put ipynb file.***
Open Jupyter Notebook in your browser and open 
```
project4.ipynb
```

#### 3.2 Open R files
Click 'run' to run each cell.

Maybe you need to wait for a while in some cells to train and load.
